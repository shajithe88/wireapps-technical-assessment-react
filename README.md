# WireApps Front-End Engineer Technical Assessment

This project is a React application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), integrated with Redux for state management, Axios for HTTP requests, React Bootstrap for UI components, and bot scraping functionality. It also utilizes the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) for retrieving fake e-commerce data.

## Technologies Used

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to start the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/shajithe88/wireapps-technical-assessment-react.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**

    ```
    cd project-directory
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```
    yarn install
    ```

4. **Start Development Server:**

    ```
    yarn start
    ```

   This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

5. **Launch Test Runner:**

    ```
    yarn test
    ```

   This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the [running tests section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

6. **Build for Production:**

    ```
    yarn build
    ```

   This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is now ready to be deployed!
